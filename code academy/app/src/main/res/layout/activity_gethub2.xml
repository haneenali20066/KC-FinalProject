        android:text="GitHub is a centralized platform. Centralized for developers all around the globe. A person can just host the repository created in Git to the whole world.  Using this, it increases the chances of better project development and in less time. GitHub provides you with the easiness of combining the changes and removes the headache of sharing the large code files. If GitHub is not there, you will face a series of challenges in order to work together as a team.
First of all, the code needs to be shared among your teammates. A code file on a big project is heavy and will take a lot of resources. After the upload, when your teammates will make the changes to the file, they still have to upload the complete file each and every time. This problem is not present when you use GitHub. Just make the changes and push only the changes to the main code file. It will be fast and easy. As a project owner, you can track these changes quite easily on it. "
